GET /api/spotify/auth/login                              # Auth URL generation
POST /api/spotify/auth/callback                          # OAuth callback
```

**âœ… Shared Types:**
- Complete Spotify type definitions (`SpotifyTrack`, `SpotifyAlbum`, `SpotifyArtist`, etc.)
- Search result interfaces
- Authentication types

### **Phase 2: Modern Frontend Architecture** âœ… **COMPLETED**

#### **2.1 What Was Implemented**

**âœ… Service Layer Architecture:**
- `spotifyApi.ts`: Backend API integration with public/authenticated endpoints
- `spotifyPlayer.ts`: Web Playback SDK isolation for premium users only
- Clean separation between data fetching and playback control

**âœ… React Hooks Pattern:**
- `useSpotifyAuth.ts`: Authentication state management
- `useSpotifyPlayer.ts`: Player controls for premium users
- `useSpotifySearch.ts`: Search functionality with backend integration

**âœ… Updated Components:**
- `SpotifyContext.tsx`: Refactored to use hooks architecture
- `SpotifySearch.tsx`: Modern implementation with new patterns
- `PlayButton.tsx`: Smart component with premium/free user logic

**âœ… Key Features Implemented:**
- **Public Search**: Works immediately without authentication
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Authenticated users get enhanced features
- **Smart Play Logic**: 
  - Unauthenticated users â†’ Login prompt
  - Free users â†’ External Spotify app redirection
  - Premium users â†’ In-browser Web Playback SDK
- **No Preview URL Dependencies**: Removed deprecated preview_url functionality

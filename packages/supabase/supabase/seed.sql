-- Sample data for development
-- Note: This file should only contain sample data, not schema definitions
-- Schema is defined in the migrations folder

-- The seed data will be inserted after a user signs up through the Supabase Auth UI
-- For now, we'll leave this empty as users need to be created through the auth system first
